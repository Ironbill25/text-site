# About

Hey! I'm IronBill25, a web developer and designer.
Some people call me IronBill05. I have a few different usernames.
One of my favorite things to do is to create websites and sometimes, games.
I've been coding websites for over 2 years and I've done some cool things.

[I have a profile on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ironbill05/) that I like to experiment in.
I also like to make music on [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/members/218234).

Check out my Neocities site [here](https://ironbill05.neocities.org/).
